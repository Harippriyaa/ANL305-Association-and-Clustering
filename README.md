# ANL305-Association-and-Clustering

ANL305 Association and Clustering equips students with the skills and knowledge in applying Association Rule Mining, Clustering, as well as related unsupervised learning techniques. The course covers general approaches to developing analytics solutions when confronted with real-world problems. Students will learn how to address the problems using the techniques taught in this course. Last but not least, students will also be exposed to applying unsupervised data exploration and analysis using cloud services.
